// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Ray/plane infinite grid with an auto-adjusting (decade-LOD) line spacing.
//
// Two things make this behave like an editor grid in a real engine rather than
// a textured plane:
//
//  1. TRUE INFINITY + CORRECT DEPTH. Each pixel's world ray is intersected
//     with y = 0. Pixels whose ray never hits the plane in front of the camera
//     are discarded, so the grid terminates exactly at the horizon. The hit
//     point is re-projected to write gl_FragDepth, so the grid depth-tests
//     against scene geometry properly instead of floating over or under it.
//
//  2. AUTO-ADJUSTING SPACING. The grid never shows a fixed 1-unit cell. It
//     measures how much world space one pixel covers (screen-space
//     derivatives) and picks the decade of spacing that keeps cells at roughly
//     uTargetCellPixels on screen. Four decades are drawn at once and
//     cross-faded by the fractional part of the LOD, so zooming slides the
//     tiers continuously (1 m -> 10 m -> 100 m ...) with no popping and
//     constant on-screen density from centimetres to kilometres.
//
//     A useful side effect: because the spacing grows with distance, the
//     argument to fract() below stays in a small numeric range even when the
//     camera is far from the origin, which is what keeps fp32 precision from
//     making distant lines wobble.
//
// The general approach (procedural lines via fract()/derivative-based
// anti-aliasing, decade LOD, ray-cast infinite plane) is the standard one used
// across many engines and public shader collections; it is not a copy of any
// single proprietary implementation.
